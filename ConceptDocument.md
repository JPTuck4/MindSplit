## Game Overview
**Title:** MindSplit  
**Platform:** Unity  
**Genre:** Multiplayer Cooperative Puzzle Game  
**Target Market:** Anyone who likes cooperative games  

**Game Vision:** As my first video game, MindSplit is meant to introduce me to the world of game development through a fun and simple project with unique gameplay mechanics. Mindsplit is a four player cooperative puzzle game where players must work together against the clock to complete each level. Each player is assigned a cardinal direction that only they can move the character towards. The game will feature various levels of increasing difficulty so you and your friends will always have a new challenge to choose from. The game will be developed and launched over the course of the next month as an assignment for an Intro to Game Programming class at the University of Tulsa.

This game was inspired by the board game Magic Maze pictured below, a cooperative game where players work together to move warriors through a shopping mall so they can find their weapons. The catch is each player can only move the pawns in one direction and players aren't alowed to communicate by any means other than a big red pawn called the 'do something' pawn. They can put this pawn in front of someone at any time in order to passive aggresively inform them that they need to do something.

## Game Objectives
Each level will spawn with multiple characters of different shapes in a maze. To complete each level, you and your friends will need to navigate each shape to their corresponding objective. The trick is, each player doesn't control a different shape, but a different direction. For example, you might be able to only move the characters to the left. You can switch between each character but can only move them to the left and will be forced to rely on your friends to move them in other directions. Along the way shapes can pick up powerups that give the team more time on the clock, but also shuffle everyones roles so everyone will get assigned a new direction. Complete a level and your team can move on to a harder level with more shapes to simultaneously control.

## Game Synopsis
**Story Setting:** MindSplit will be an abstract puzzle game with no setting other than a maze with different colored shapes and matching objective spaces  
**Player's Role:** In MindSplit, players will not each control a different shape but a different cardinal direction.
